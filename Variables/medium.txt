Medium Challenges

1. FizzBuzz with a Twist: Write a FizzBuzz program (prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both) that uses only two variables in the entire program.

2. String Reversal: Create a function that reverses a string using a loop and variable assignment. It should handle strings with spaces and punctuation correctly.

3. Prime Number Checker: Write a program that checks if a number stored in a variable is a prime number or not. The check should be performed in a function.

4. Fibonacci Sequence: Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, where n is a variable. Use iteration and ensure that your variables are named clearly.

5. Sorting Algorithm: Implement a simple sorting algorithm (like bubble sort or selection sort) using variables to perform the necessary swaps. Make sure to explain the logic with comments.
